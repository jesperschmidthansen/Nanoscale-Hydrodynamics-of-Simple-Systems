**** UNDER CONSTRUCTION! **** 

In this repository you will find additional resources for the book
"Nanoscale Hydrodynamics of Simple Systems" by J.S. Hansen (Cambridge University
Press, 2022).

The folders contain

* Videos: A series of videos on the molecular dynamics software (molsim) used in
  the book. This includes an installation guide and simulation of simple
  systems.
 
* Code: Molecular dynamics and data analysis code that can help you investigate
  the research questions proposed in the book's "Further Explorations". Notice
  that molsim must be installed for the code to work.
  
* Help: Here you can find the molsim tutorial as well as data and plots to some
  of the "Further Explorations".
  
* Erratum: A list of the book's errata.

The repository will be updated. 

NOTICE: If you wish to run molsim under Matlab, I recommend that you consult the
tutorial for the installation.
