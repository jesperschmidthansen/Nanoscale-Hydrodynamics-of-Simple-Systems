\maketitle

This addendum is based on some of my own notes that did not make the book as well as some newer post-publication results. I hope this can 
be a helpful suppliment to some readers.

\subsection*{The relation between angular velocity and vorticity}
\subsection*{Shear waves: A straightforward derivation}
\subsection*{On the perturbation analysis of mixtures in temperature gradients}
